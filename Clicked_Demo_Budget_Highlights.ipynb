business systems fy 2023 department of the navy budget 13 3 tool forcing the don to evaluate how effective our collective team is in both small and large ways to prioritize the remediation of audit deficiencies in fy 2020 the don developed the audit roadmap and integrated master schedule which provided an integrated comprehensive plan to help the don achieve an audit opinion by fy 2028 we are executing against the audit roadmap to integrate systems improvements and consolidation efforts with budgetary reform and business process transformation the plan has helped the don to identify and track dependencies and has been monitored to identify risks and mitigation approaches ensuring unity of effort across the enterprise and simplifying progress tracking and reporting in executing against the audit roadmap during the fy 2021 audit the navy surmounted the obstacles presented by the covid 19 pandemic to successfully downgrade its real property utilities material weakness mw it also sustained remediation of previously closed or downgraded mws in general fund real property working capital fund real property contract authority ability to provide complete timely and sufficient evidence and contingent legal liabilities to date the department of the navy has downgraded more material weaknesses than any other military department or defense agency consolidate and or decommission seven financially relevant systems to shed legacy systems automate clean and standardize data and shift efforts from a transactional orientation to high value analytics transition the

data analytics platform which significantly improves the timeliness and accuracy of our checkbook reconciliations with treasury in fy 2022 the don will continue executing against a rebaselined audit roadmap but measure audit progress in terms of the percentage of assets and liabilities that are considered auditable from the auditor s perspective as such our fy 2022 remediation efforts prioritize high dollar balance sheet line items for the greatest impact to auditability the don has had a lot of success in addressing material weaknesses however not all material weaknesses have to be addressed to earn an audit opinion in fact two of the navy s highest priorities for fy 2022 address a significant portion of the balance sheet remediation efforts will fully establish auditability of navy s environmental and disposal liabilities which account for over 50 percent of the navy general fund s total liabilities by completing remediation on construction in progress the general property plant

marine corps operational concepts will be able to reach their full warfighting potential this talent management system will enable the marine corps to better harness and develop the unique skills and strengths of marines improve the performance of units in competition and combat and ensure the marine corps remains most ready when the nation is least ready today and into the future training and education reform the complexity and change of the modern battlefield requires a highly trained and educated force the marine corps is changing the training and education continuum from an industrial age model to an information age model the warfighting impact of all future capabilities is directly tied to the level of commitment made to training and education modernization the marine corps cannot assume it will maintain a technical advantage over peer competitor military forces as such it is even more critical to maintain a competitive edge in decision making at both the individual marine and unit level of competence the goal of this initiative is to adopt an information age approach toward training and education that produces better leaders and warfighters this approach includes focusing on identifying developing and sustaining the unique talents of individual marines increasing intellectual standards focusing training and education on critical thinking and practical judgement under pressure expanding the use of wargaming and force on force training making live virtual constructive training a normal part of the training continuum and incorporating more naval education and

audit and business systems audit business transformation the navy and marine corps have benefitted greatly from annual financial statement audits and our team is aggressively working to remediate the root causes of the discrepancies found by our auditors we embrace auditor findings that highlight opportunities for operational and process improvements and as professionals capitalize on them unafraid of the scrutiny navy and marine corps leaders use the lessons learned from the audit as a means of improving our warfighting capability and readiness and demonstrating excellence as an example the marine corps will be undergoing a one time two year audit cycle for fy 2022 through fy 2023 the two year audit cycle will give auditors sufficient time to complete necessary year end testing and focus on design implementation and evaluation of key internal controls so that a positive opinion may be rendered by complying with the federal accounting standards advisory board fasab and generally accepted accounting principles gaap which must be in place to receive a favorable audit opinion business managers are becoming increasingly stronger stewards of public funds and able to properly account for every taxpayer dollar spent the fasab is the body of experts designated to set u s generally accepted accounting principles for the u s government and its component entities leaders at every echelon are taking responsibility for ensuring that strengthened internal controls over business processes and systems are in place the primary pillar in the don s audit remediation strategy is reforming the department s business systems environment initiatives are underway to consolidate and reduce the number of accounting systems used to expand the capabilities of the target finance accounting and logistics enterprise resource planning erp system and to strengthen the key internal controls governing business processes including entity level monitoring financial management and business systems e g security access and interface controls to date these transformation efforts are yielding significant measurable impacts in the areas of asset accountability and traceability enhanced cybersecurity and modernized it systems and improved fiscal discipline for instance the don strengthening strategic partnerships audit and business systems 2022 13 2 fy 2023 department of the navy budget completed an inventory clean up initiative spanning from fy 2018 to fy 2021 and identified 4 3 billion in previously untracked materiel additionally the don shut down five general ledger

enterprise wide automation center of excellence has deployed 74 automations to date and 79 are in development to pivot the don workforce from repetitious data crunching to value laden data analytics these actions in addition to business process improvements will require an investment in resources to complete them this investment will yield dividends ultimately resulting in a favorable opinion on yearly financial statement audits the most beneficial return on investment will be greater data accuracy and transparency for decision makers when public funds are spent this will boost confidence that taxpayers and congress have in the department as its managers spend dollars in support of our warfighters auditability progress at the end of its fy 2022 audit the navy will have completed its fifth full scope financial statement audit the marine corps will complete its sixth full scope financial statement audit at the end of fy 2023 results will highlight specific deficiencies in systems

business systems fy 2023 department of the navy budget 13 3 tool forcing the don to evaluate how effective our collective team is in both small and large ways to prioritize the remediation of audit deficiencies in fy 2020 the don developed the audit roadmap and integrated master schedule which provided an integrated comprehensive plan to help the don achieve an audit opinion by fy 2028 we are executing against the audit roadmap to integrate systems improvements and consolidation efforts with budgetary reform and business process transformation the plan has helped the don to identify and track dependencies and has been monitored to identify risks and mitigation approaches ensuring unity of effort across the enterprise and simplifying progress tracking and reporting in executing against the audit roadmap during the fy 2021 audit the navy surmounted the obstacles presented by the covid 19 pandemic to successfully downgrade its real property utilities material weakness mw it also sustained remediation of previously closed or downgraded mws in general fund real property working capital fund real property contract authority ability to provide complete timely and sufficient

data analytics platform which significantly improves the timeliness and accuracy of our checkbook reconciliations with treasury in fy 2022 the don will continue executing against a rebaselined audit roadmap but measure audit progress in terms of the percentage of assets and liabilities that are considered auditable from the auditor s perspective as such our fy 2022 remediation efforts prioritize high dollar balance sheet line items for the greatest impact to auditability the don has had a lot of success in addressing material weaknesses however not all material weaknesses have to be addressed to earn an audit opinion in fact two of the navy s highest priorities for fy 2022 address a significant portion of the balance sheet remediation efforts will fully establish auditability of navy s environmental and disposal liabilities which account for over 50 percent of the navy general fund s total liabilities by completing remediation on construction in progress the general property plant and equipment line item will become auditable this accounts for 60 percent of the navy general fund s total assets the navy is on track to downgrade these two material weaknesses environmental and disposal liabilities and construction in progress in fy 2022 another focus area for fy 2022 is fund balance with treasury which equates to balancing navy s checkbook with the treasury we have partnered with the office of the under secretary of defense comptroller and implemented a modern and reliable process to reconcile our cash activity with the treasury we are operationalizing internal controls that will be tested by our auditor in fy 2022 we are also partnering with the defense finance and accounting service to improve process times for identifying and resolving differences of course one of the navy s top priorities in fy 2022 is to robustly support the marine corps in its two year audit cycle to achieve an audit opinion in fy 2023 this is reflective of the navy marine
