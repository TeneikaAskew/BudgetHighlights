prioritize high-dollar balance sheet line items for the greatest \\nimpact to auditability.', 'The DON has had a lot of success in addressing material \\nweaknesses; however, not all material weaknesses have to be addressed to earn an \\naudit opinion.', 'In fact, two of the Navy’s highest priorities for FY 2022 address a \\nsignificant portion of the Balance Sheet.', '• Remediation efforts will fully establish auditability of Navy’s Environmental \\nand Disposal Liabilities, which account for over 50 percent of the Navy General \\nFund’s total liabilities.', '• \\nBy completing remediation on Construction in Progress, the General Property, Plant, \\nand Equipment line item will become auditable.', 'This accounts for 60 percent of the \\nNavy General Fund’s total assets.', 'The Navy is on track to downgrade these two material weaknesses--Environmental \\nand Disposal Liabilities and Construction in Progress--in FY 2022.', 'Another focus area for FY 2022 is Fund Balance

strategic guidance for america to retain control of the seas we must maintain a clear eyed resolve to compete deter and win today while accelerating the development of a more lethal fleet we must do so while integrating more closely with the marine corps and coast guard to generate integrated all domain naval power admiral michael gilday the chief of naval operations cno strategic priorities outlined in the cno navigation plan navplan 2021 are focused on the navy s efforts across four main priorities readiness capabilities modernization capacity and sailors the direction in the navplan 2021 remains valid and relevant an update is being prepared to build on this strong foundation readiness touches all elements of our navy from our shipyards and aviation depots to the steaming and flying hours our sailors use to hone their skills over the last several years the navy has improved its readiness through sustained funding and a relentless focus on reform we will sustain these gains and increase the speed of our recovery to field a more ready lethal force delivering emerging capabilities at speed and scale requires every member of our navy team including our industry academic and research partners to embrace the urgency of the moment our maritime supremacy is being challenged this means developing innovative systems modernizing legacy ones and rigorously aligning our acquisition enterprise with operational requirements it also requires coordinating capabilities with our robust network of allies and partners for capacity sea control and sea denial from beneath the seas is one of our core advantages we will not yield any ground to our competitors unmanned platforms play a vital role in our future fleet successfully integrating unmanned platforms under on and above the sea gives our commanders better options to fight and win in contested spaces 2022 introduction fy 2023 department of the navy budget 1 7 our sailors active and reserve and the civilians who enable them are the true source of our naval power controlling the seas and projecting power requires our sailors to operate seamlessly in all domains and across the competition continuum we recognize the strength we gain from a diverse force and actively pursue combat minded sailors with varied sets of knowledge skills and experiences to operate sustain and maintain the fighting power of the navy we will accelerate their development and harness their talents to keep america safe and prosperous commandant of the marine corps cmc strategic guidance we cannot accept or accede to recommendations for incremental change or better versions of legacy capabilities but must pursue transformational capabilities that will provide naval fleets and joint force commanders with a competitive advantage in the gray zone and during contingency general david h berger in united states marine corps force design 2030 aligned with emerging joint and naval operating concepts such as littoral operations in a contested environment loce expeditionary advanced base operations eabo distributed maritime operations dmo and a concept for stand in forces the marine corps is aggressively redesigning the force to deter conflict and actively persist as the nation s stand in force inside an adversary s weapons engagement zone wez the fleet marine force fmf is in the process of transforming into a modernized force with new organic capabilities organized trained equipped and postured to meet the demands of the rapidly evolving future operating environment and optimized for the challenges of naval expeditionary warfare in the maritime littorals as delineated in the commandant s planning guidance cpg and force design 2030 the commandant s force design initiatives encompass a comprehensive

modernization the marine corps continues to aggressively adapt organize train and equip to meet the demands of the increasingly competitive future operating environment developing new capabilities and modernizing equipment in order to deter malign behavior fight inside peer threat weapon sensors and weapons engagement zones and facilitate sea denial and sea control in support of fleet operations and the joint force supported by a campaign of analysis to include wargaming modeling and simulation the marine corps has continued to identify and divest of legacy capability and excess capacity that is not best aligned to meet the future threat the ability to reinvest divested savings into investments in long range precision fires and anti surface warfare capabilities networks sensors intelligence platforms air defense ground combat lethality and science and technology programs will sustain the velocity of modernization efforts the speed of which has been set by strategic competitors through prioritized investments in warfighting capabilities the marine corps will contribute to the joint force by providing naval expeditionary forces actively persisting inside contested spaces leveraging all domain tools as the eyes and ears of the fleet and joint force completing naval and joint kill webs competing with peer adversaries in the maritime gray zone and complicating an adversary s decision calculus while maintaining its role as america s force in readiness deterring adversaries and responding to crisis globally talent management reform first and foremost the strength of the marine corps is still marines to be successful in the competitions and conflicts of the 21st century the marine corps must take full advantage of the talents strengths skills and perspectives of every marine the commandant has identified that the marine corps current industrial age manpower management processes and systems require fundamental changes to support force design 2030 and the requirements of the future operating environment as articulated in talent management 2030 the marine corps 2022 introduction fy 2023 department of the navy budget 1 9 will implement new models for recruiting talent establish an assignment process consistent with the marine corps warfighting philosophy introduce new measures to increase career flexibility and adopt modern digital tools processes and analytics consistent with industry standards human resource research and best practices of adjacent services the commandant s goal is to develop a talent management system that measures success by an ability to attract recruit identify incentivize and retain the most talented individuals across the entire force by recruiting developing and retaining the right marines modern marine corps operational concepts will be able to reach their full warfighting potential this talent management system will enable the marine corps to better harness and develop the unique skills and strengths of marines improve the performance of units in competition and combat and ensure the marine corps remains most ready when the nation is least ready today and into the future training and education reform the complexity and change of the modern battlefield requires a highly trained and educated force the marine corps is changing the training and education continuum from an industrial age model to an information age model the warfighting impact of all future capabilities is directly tied to the level of commitment made to training and education modernization the marine corps cannot assume it will maintain a technical advantage over peer competitor military forces as such it is even more critical to maintain a competitive edge in decision making at both the individual marine and unit level of competence the goal of this initiative is to adopt an information age approach toward training and education that produces better leaders and warfighters this approach includes focusing on identifying developing and sustaining the unique talents of individual marines increasing intellectual standards focusing training and education on critical thinking and practical judgement under pressure expanding the use of wargaming and force on force training making live virtual constructive training a normal part of the training continuum and incorporating more naval education and training within the existing service centric architecture introduction 2022 1 10 fy 2023 department of the navy budget security and operational environment china s ascendance as a great military power poses the most serious potential threat to the u s and its allies for the first time since the defeat of the soviet union we have a strategic competitor with naval capabilities and capacities that rival and in some areas surpass our own though the people s liberation army navy plan has only about half the tonnage of the u s navy it has 355 ships constituting the largest navy in the world in addition the plan s overall battle force is expected to grow to 460 ships by 2030 given its narrower scope of operations and geographic commitments than our navy the plan has enough ships to pose a serious challenge to the u s navy this reality becomes particularly stark when one considers the likely areas of aggression lie close to the chinese mainland home to the largest missile force in the

territorial claims and challenge to freedom of navigation in the south china sea the prc uses every advantage in a coercive extractive and dangerously irresponsible manner beijing uses economic leverage like predatory lending to force governments from asia to africa to south america to cede critical infrastructure and natural resources it uses diplomatic leverage to exact political retribution against other countries and to expand its sphere of influence it leverages technology to steal personal information and intellectual property and subvert the free flow of communication around the world and finally it uses military leverage to threaten its neighbors challenge established norms and attempt to control international waters as its own the prc threatens u s interests undermines alliances and partnerships and degrades the free and open international order introduction 2022 1 12 fy 2023 department of the navy budget figure 1 2 operational context the spectrum of potential conflict the u s must prepare for is wide potential adversaries can attack in multiple domains and geographic locations the u s and its allies currently defend against offensive cyber

capability to defend the country and our allies in multiple domains to include the sea air and the cyber realm it must be able to do this in cooperation with sister services and allies and it must be able to succeed in multiple domains simultaneously since the time of the barbary pirates our navy and marine corps team has protected the seaways that are the lifeblood of u s global economic activity the vast majority of the world s manufactured goods are transported by ocean freight a substantial amount of the world s internet traffic traverse seafloor communication lines and a large amount of natural resources reside in ocean environments with so much depending on safe access to the world s oceans priority must be given to the sea going military services china in particular has chosen to enhance its ability to project military power into the maritime domain from more aggressive overflight of taiwan airspace to the militarization of reefs and islands in the south china sea china grows

root causes of the discrepancies found by our auditors we embrace auditor findings that highlight opportunities for operational and process improvements and as professionals capitalize on them unafraid of the scrutiny navy and marine corps leaders use the lessons learned from the audit as a means of improving our warfighting capability and readiness and demonstrating excellence as an example the marine corps will be undergoing a one time two year audit cycle for fy 2022 through fy 2023 the two year audit cycle will give auditors sufficient time to complete necessary year end testing and focus on design implementation and evaluation of key internal controls so that a positive opinion may be rendered by complying with the federal accounting standards advisory board fasab and generally accepted accounting principles gaap which must be in place to receive a favorable audit opinion business managers are becoming increasingly stronger stewards of public funds and able to properly account for every taxpayer dollar spent the fasab is the body of experts designated to set u s generally accepted accounting principles for the u s government and its component entities leaders at every echelon are taking responsibility for ensuring that strengthened internal controls over business processes and systems are in place the primary pillar in the don s audit remediation strategy is reforming the department s business systems environment initiatives are underway to consolidate and reduce the number of accounting systems used to expand the capabilities of the target finance accounting and logistics enterprise resource planning erp system and to strengthen the key internal controls governing business processes including entity level monitoring financial management

enterprise wide automation center of excellence has deployed 74 automations to date and 79 are in development to pivot the don workforce from repetitious data crunching to value laden data analytics these actions in addition to business process improvements will require an investment in resources to complete them this investment will yield dividends ultimately resulting in a favorable opinion on yearly financial statement audits the most beneficial return on investment will be greater data accuracy and transparency for decision makers when public funds are spent this will boost confidence that taxpayers and congress have in the department as its managers spend dollars in support of our warfighters auditability progress at the end of its fy 2022 audit the navy will have completed its fifth full scope financial statement audit the marine corps will complete its sixth full scope financial statement audit at the end of fy 2023 results will highlight specific deficiencies in systems

deficiencies in fy 2020 the don developed the audit roadmap and integrated master schedule which provided an integrated comprehensive plan to help the don achieve an audit opinion by fy 2028 we are executing against the audit roadmap to integrate systems improvements and consolidation efforts with budgetary reform and business process transformation the plan has helped the don to identify and track dependencies and has been monitored to identify risks and mitigation approaches ensuring unity of effort across the enterprise and simplifying progress tracking and reporting in executing

roadmap but measure audit progress in terms of the percentage of assets and liabilities that are considered auditable from the auditor s perspective as such our fy 2022 remediation efforts prioritize high dollar balance sheet line items for the greatest impact to auditability the don has had a lot of success in addressing material weaknesses however not all material weaknesses have to be addressed to earn an audit opinion in fact two of the navy s highest priorities for fy 2022 address a significant portion of the balance sheet remediation efforts will fully establish auditability of navy s environmental and disposal liabilities which account for over 50 percent of the navy general fund s total liabilities by completing remediation on construction in progress the general property plant and equipment line item will become auditable this accounts for 60 percent of the navy general fund s total assets the navy is on track to downgrade these two material weaknesses environmental and disposal liabilities and construction in progress in fy 2022 another focus area for fy 2022 is fund balance with treasury which equates to balancing navy s checkbook with the treasury we have partnered with the office of the under secretary of defense comptroller and implemented a modern and reliable process to reconcile our cash activity with the treasury we are operationalizing internal controls that will be tested by our auditor in fy 2022 we are also partnering with the defense finance and accounting service to improve process times for identifying and resolving differences of

strategic guidance for america to retain control of the seas we must maintain a clear eyed resolve to compete deter and win today while accelerating the development of a more lethal fleet we must do so while integrating more closely with the marine corps and coast guard to generate integrated all domain naval power admiral michael gilday the chief of naval operations cno strategic priorities outlined in the cno navigation plan navplan 2021 are focused on the navy s efforts across four main priorities readiness capabilities modernization capacity and sailors the direction in the navplan 2021 remains valid and relevant an update is being prepared to build on this strong foundation readiness touches all elements of our navy from our shipyards and aviation depots to the steaming and flying hours our sailors use to hone their skills over the last several years the navy has improved its readiness through sustained funding and a relentless focus on reform we will sustain these gains and increase the speed of our recovery to field a more ready lethal force delivering emerging capabilities at speed and scale requires every member of our navy team including our industry academic and research partners to embrace the urgency of the moment our maritime supremacy is being challenged this means developing innovative systems modernizing legacy ones and rigorously aligning our acquisition enterprise with operational requirements it also requires coordinating capabilities with our robust network of allies and partners for capacity sea control and sea denial from beneath the seas is one of our core advantages we will not yield any ground to our competitors unmanned platforms play a vital role in our future fleet successfully integrating unmanned platforms under on and above the sea gives our commanders better options to fight and win in contested spaces 2022 introduction fy 2023 department of the navy budget 1 7 our sailors active and reserve and the civilians who enable them are the true source of our naval power controlling the seas and projecting power requires our sailors to operate seamlessly in all domains and across the competition continuum we recognize the strength we gain from a diverse force and actively pursue combat minded sailors with varied sets of knowledge skills and experiences to operate sustain and maintain the fighting power of the navy we will accelerate their development and harness their talents to keep america safe and prosperous commandant of the marine corps cmc strategic guidance we cannot accept or accede to recommendations for incremental change or better versions of legacy capabilities but must pursue transformational capabilities that will provide naval fleets and joint force commanders with a competitive advantage in the gray zone and during contingency general david h berger in united states marine corps force design 2030 aligned with emerging joint and naval operating concepts such as littoral operations in a contested environment loce expeditionary advanced base operations eabo distributed maritime operations dmo and a concept for stand in forces the marine corps is aggressively redesigning the force to deter conflict and actively persist as the nation s stand in force inside an adversary s weapons engagement zone wez the fleet marine force fmf is in the process of transforming into a modernized force with new organic capabilities organized trained equipped and postured to meet the demands of the rapidly evolving future operating environment and optimized for the challenges of naval expeditionary warfare in the maritime littorals as delineated in the commandant s planning guidance cpg and force design 2030 the commandant s force design initiatives encompass a comprehensive

modernization the marine corps continues to aggressively adapt organize train and equip to meet the demands of the increasingly competitive future operating environment developing new capabilities and modernizing equipment in order to deter malign behavior fight inside peer threat weapon sensors and weapons engagement zones and facilitate sea denial and sea control in support of fleet operations and the joint force supported by a campaign of analysis to include wargaming modeling and simulation the marine corps has continued to identify and divest of legacy capability and excess capacity that is not best aligned to meet the future threat the ability to reinvest divested savings into investments in long range precision fires and anti surface warfare capabilities networks sensors intelligence platforms air defense ground combat lethality and science and technology programs will sustain the velocity of modernization efforts the speed of which has been set by strategic competitors through prioritized investments in warfighting capabilities the marine corps will contribute to the joint force by providing naval expeditionary forces actively persisting inside contested spaces leveraging all domain tools as the eyes and ears of the fleet and joint force completing naval and joint kill webs competing with peer adversaries in the maritime gray zone and complicating an adversary s decision calculus while maintaining its role as america s force in readiness deterring adversaries and responding to crisis globally talent management reform first and foremost the strength of the marine corps is still marines to be successful in the competitions and conflicts of the 21st century the marine corps must take full advantage of the talents strengths skills and perspectives of every marine the commandant has identified that the marine corps current industrial age manpower management processes and systems require fundamental changes to support force design 2030 and the requirements of the future operating environment as articulated in talent management 2030 the marine corps 2022 introduction fy 2023 department of the navy budget 1 9 will implement new models for recruiting talent establish an assignment process consistent with the marine corps warfighting philosophy introduce new measures to increase career flexibility and adopt modern digital tools processes and analytics consistent with industry standards human resource research and best practices of adjacent services the commandant s goal is to develop a talent management system that measures success by an ability to attract recruit identify incentivize and retain the most talented individuals across the entire force by recruiting developing and retaining the right marines modern marine corps operational concepts will be able to reach their full warfighting potential this talent management system will enable the marine corps to better harness and develop the unique skills and strengths of marines improve the performance of units in competition and combat and ensure the marine corps remains most ready when the nation is least ready today and into the future training and education reform the complexity and change of the modern battlefield requires a highly trained and educated force the marine corps is changing the training and education continuum from an industrial age model to an information age model the warfighting impact of all future capabilities is directly tied to the level of commitment made to training and education modernization the marine corps cannot assume it will maintain a technical advantage over peer competitor military forces as such it is even more critical to maintain a competitive edge in decision making at both the individual marine and unit level of competence the goal of this initiative is to adopt an information age approach toward training and education that produces better leaders and warfighters this approach includes focusing on identifying developing and sustaining the unique talents of individual marines increasing intellectual standards focusing training and education on critical thinking and practical judgement under pressure expanding the use of wargaming and force on force training making live virtual constructive training a normal part of the training continuum and incorporating more naval education and training within the existing service centric architecture introduction 2022 1 10 fy 2023 department of the navy budget security and operational environment china s ascendance as a great military power poses the most serious potential threat to the u s and its allies for the first time since the defeat of the soviet union we have a strategic competitor with naval capabilities and capacities that rival and in some areas surpass our own though the people s liberation army navy plan has only about half the tonnage of the u s navy it has 355 ships constituting the largest navy in the world in addition the plan s overall battle force is expected to grow to 460 ships by 2030 given its narrower scope of operations and geographic commitments than our navy the plan has enough ships to pose a serious challenge to the u s navy this reality becomes particularly stark when one considers the likely areas of aggression lie close to the chinese mainland home to the largest missile force in the

capability to defend the country and our allies in multiple domains to include the sea air and the cyber realm it must be able to do this in cooperation with sister services and allies and it must be able to succeed in multiple domains simultaneously since the time of the barbary pirates our navy and marine corps team has protected the seaways that are the lifeblood of u s global economic activity the vast majority of the world s manufactured goods are transported by ocean freight a substantial amount of the world s internet traffic traverse seafloor communication lines and a large amount of natural resources reside in ocean environments with so much depending on safe access to the world s oceans priority must be given to the sea going military services china in particular has chosen to enhance its ability to project military power into the maritime domain from more aggressive overflight of taiwan airspace to the militarization of reefs and islands in the south china sea china grows

audit and business systems audit business transformation the navy and marine corps have benefitted greatly from annual financial statement audits and our team is aggressively working to remediate the root causes of the discrepancies found by our auditors we embrace auditor findings that highlight opportunities for operational and process improvements and as professionals capitalize on them unafraid of the scrutiny navy and marine corps leaders use the lessons learned from the audit as a means of improving our warfighting capability and readiness and demonstrating excellence as an example the marine corps will be undergoing a one time two year audit cycle for fy 2022 through fy 2023 the two year audit cycle will give auditors sufficient time to complete necessary year end testing and focus on design implementation and evaluation of key internal controls so that a positive opinion may be rendered by complying with the federal accounting standards advisory board fasab and generally accepted accounting principles gaap which must be in place to receive a favorable audit opinion business managers are becoming increasingly stronger stewards of public funds and able to properly account for every taxpayer dollar spent the fasab is the body of experts designated to set u s generally accepted accounting principles for the u s government and its component entities leaders at every echelon are taking responsibility for ensuring that strengthened internal controls over business processes and systems are in place the primary pillar in the don s audit remediation strategy is reforming the department s business systems environment initiatives are underway to consolidate and reduce the number of accounting systems used to expand the capabilities of the target finance accounting and logistics enterprise resource planning erp system and to strengthen the key internal controls governing business processes including entity level monitoring financial management and business systems e g security access and interface controls to date these transformation efforts are yielding significant measurable impacts in the areas of asset accountability and traceability enhanced cybersecurity and modernized it systems and improved fiscal discipline for instance the don strengthening strategic partnerships audit and business systems 2022 13 2 fy 2023 department of the navy budget completed an inventory clean up initiative spanning from fy 2018 to fy 2021 and identified 4 3 billion in previously untracked materiel additionally the don shut down five general ledger

enterprise wide automation center of excellence has deployed 74 automations to date and 79 are in development to pivot the don workforce from repetitious data crunching to value laden data analytics these actions in addition to business process improvements will require an investment in resources to complete them this investment will yield dividends ultimately resulting in a favorable opinion on yearly financial statement audits the most beneficial return on investment will be greater data accuracy and transparency for decision makers when public funds are spent this will boost confidence that taxpayers and congress have in the department as its managers spend dollars in support of our warfighters auditability progress at the end of its fy 2022 audit the navy will have completed its fifth full scope financial statement audit the marine corps will complete its sixth full scope financial statement audit at the end of fy 2023 results will highlight specific deficiencies in systems

business systems fy 2023 department of the navy budget 13 3 tool forcing the don to evaluate how effective our collective team is in both small and large ways to prioritize the remediation of audit deficiencies in fy 2020 the don developed the audit roadmap and integrated master schedule which provided an integrated comprehensive plan to help the don achieve an audit opinion by fy 2028 we are executing against the audit roadmap to integrate systems improvements and consolidation efforts with budgetary reform and business process transformation the plan has helped the don to identify and track dependencies and has been monitored to identify risks and mitigation approaches ensuring unity of effort across the enterprise and simplifying progress tracking and reporting in executing against the audit roadmap during the fy 2021 audit the navy surmounted the obstacles presented by the covid 19 pandemic to successfully downgrade its real property utilities material weakness mw it

data analytics platform which significantly improves the timeliness and accuracy of our checkbook reconciliations with treasury in fy 2022 the don will continue executing against a rebaselined audit roadmap but measure audit progress in terms of the percentage of assets and liabilities that are considered auditable from the auditor s perspective as such our fy 2022 remediation efforts prioritize high dollar balance sheet line items for the greatest impact to auditability the don has had a lot of success in addressing material weaknesses however not all material weaknesses have to be addressed to earn an audit opinion in fact two of the navy s highest priorities for fy 2022 address a significant portion of the balance sheet remediation efforts will fully establish auditability of navy s environmental and disposal liabilities which account for over 50 percent of the navy general fund s total liabilities by completing remediation on construction in progress the general property plant and equipment line item will become auditable this accounts for 60 percent of the navy general fund s total assets the navy is on track to downgrade these two material weaknesses environmental and disposal liabilities and construction in progress in fy 2022 another focus area for fy 2022 is fund balance with treasury which equates to balancing navy s checkbook with the treasury we have partnered with the office of the under secretary of defense comptroller and implemented a modern and reliable process to reconcile our cash activity with the treasury we are operationalizing internal controls that will be tested by our auditor in fy 2022 we are also partnering with the defense finance and accounting service to improve process times for identifying and resolving differences of course one of the navy s top priorities in fy 2022 is to robustly support the marine corps in its two year audit cycle to achieve an audit opinion in fy 2023 this is reflective of the navy marine

strategic guidance for america to retain control of the seas we must maintain a clear eyed resolve to compete deter and win today while accelerating the development of a more lethal fleet we must do so while integrating more closely with the marine corps and coast guard to generate integrated all domain naval power admiral michael gilday the chief of naval operations cno strategic priorities outlined in the cno navigation plan navplan 2021 are focused on the navy s efforts across four main priorities readiness capabilities modernization capacity and sailors the direction in the navplan 2021 remains valid and relevant an update is being prepared to build on this strong foundation readiness touches all elements of our navy from our shipyards and aviation depots to the steaming and flying hours our sailors use to hone their skills over the last several years the navy has improved its readiness through sustained funding and a relentless focus on reform we will sustain these gains and increase the speed of our recovery to field a more ready lethal force delivering emerging capabilities at speed and scale requires every member of our navy team including our industry academic and research partners to embrace the urgency of the moment our maritime supremacy is being challenged this means developing innovative systems modernizing legacy ones and rigorously aligning our acquisition enterprise with operational requirements it also requires coordinating capabilities with our robust network of allies and partners for capacity sea control and sea denial from beneath the seas is one of our core advantages we will not yield any ground to our competitors unmanned platforms play a vital role in our future fleet successfully integrating unmanned platforms under on and above the sea gives our commanders better options to fight and win in contested spaces 2022 introduction fy 2023 department of the navy budget 1 7 our sailors active and reserve and the civilians who enable them are the true source of our naval power controlling the seas and projecting power requires our sailors to operate seamlessly in all domains and across the competition continuum we recognize the strength we gain from a diverse force and actively pursue combat minded sailors with varied sets of knowledge skills and experiences to operate sustain and maintain the fighting power of the navy we will accelerate their development and harness their talents to keep america safe and prosperous commandant of the marine corps cmc strategic guidance we cannot accept or accede to recommendations for incremental change or better versions of legacy capabilities but must pursue transformational capabilities that will provide naval fleets and joint force commanders with a competitive advantage in the gray zone and during contingency general david h berger in united states marine corps force design 2030 aligned with emerging joint and naval operating concepts such as littoral operations in a contested environment loce expeditionary advanced base operations eabo distributed maritime operations dmo and a concept for stand in forces the marine corps is aggressively redesigning the force to deter conflict and actively persist as the nation s stand in force inside an adversary s weapons engagement zone wez the fleet marine force fmf is in the process of transforming into a modernized force with new organic capabilities organized trained equipped and postured to meet the demands of the rapidly evolving future operating environment and optimized for the challenges of naval expeditionary warfare in the maritime littorals as delineated in the commandant s planning guidance cpg and force design 2030 the commandant s force design initiatives encompass a comprehensive modernization effort to transform the organization through a threat informed concept based approach the future fmf will enable the navy and marine corps to restore the introduction 2022 1 8 fy 2023 department of the navy budget strategic initiative and to define the future of maritime conflict by capitalizing on innovative capabilities to operate persistently inside actively contested spaces as part of a naval expeditionary force force design in fy 2023 maintains focus on three overarching priorities equipment modernization talent management reform and training and education reform equipment modernization the marine corps continues to aggressively adapt organize train and equip to meet the demands of the increasingly competitive future operating environment developing new capabilities and modernizing equipment in order to deter malign behavior fight inside peer threat weapon sensors and weapons engagement zones and facilitate sea denial and sea control in support of fleet operations and the joint force supported by a campaign of analysis to include wargaming modeling and simulation the marine corps has continued to identify and divest of legacy capability and excess capacity that is not best aligned to meet the future threat the ability to reinvest divested savings into investments in long range precision fires and anti surface warfare capabilities networks sensors intelligence platforms air defense ground combat lethality and science and technology programs will sustain the velocity of modernization efforts the speed of which has been set by strategic competitors through prioritized investments in warfighting capabilities the marine corps will contribute to the joint force by providing naval expeditionary forces actively persisting inside contested spaces leveraging all domain tools as the eyes and ears of the fleet and joint force completing naval and joint kill webs competing with peer adversaries in the maritime gray zone and complicating an adversary s decision calculus while maintaining its role as america s force in readiness deterring adversaries and responding to crisis globally talent management reform first and foremost the strength of the marine corps is still marines to be successful in the competitions and conflicts of the 21st century the marine corps must take full advantage of the talents strengths skills and perspectives of every marine the commandant has identified that the marine corps current industrial age manpower management processes and systems require fundamental changes to support force design 2030 and the requirements of the future operating environment as articulated in talent management 2030 the marine corps 2022 introduction fy 2023 department of the navy budget 1 9 will implement new models for recruiting talent establish an assignment process consistent with the marine corps warfighting philosophy introduce new measures to increase career flexibility and adopt modern digital tools processes and analytics consistent with industry standards human resource research and best practices of adjacent services the commandant s goal is to develop a talent management system that measures success by an ability to attract recruit identify incentivize and retain the most talented individuals across the entire force by recruiting developing and retaining the right marines modern marine corps operational concepts will be able to reach their full warfighting potential this talent management system will enable the marine corps to better harness and develop the unique skills and strengths of marines improve the performance of units in competition and combat and ensure the marine corps remains most ready when the nation is least ready today and into the future training and education reform the complexity and change of the modern battlefield requires a highly trained and educated force the marine corps is changing the training and education continuum from an industrial age model to an information age model the warfighting impact of all future capabilities is directly tied to the level of commitment made to training and education modernization the marine corps cannot assume it will maintain a technical advantage over peer competitor military forces as such it is even more critical to maintain a competitive edge in decision making at both the individual marine and unit level of competence the goal of this initiative is to adopt an information age approach toward training and education that produces better leaders and warfighters this approach includes focusing on identifying developing and sustaining the unique talents of individual marines increasing intellectual standards focusing training and education on critical thinking and practical judgement under pressure expanding the use of wargaming and force on force training making live virtual constructive training a normal part of the training continuum and incorporating more naval education and training within the existing service centric architecture introduction 2022 1 10 fy 2023 department of the navy budget security and operational environment china s ascendance as a great military power poses the most serious potential threat to the u s and its allies for the first time since the defeat of the soviet union we have a strategic competitor with naval capabilities and capacities that rival and in some areas surpass our own though the people s liberation army navy plan has only about half the tonnage of the u s navy it has 355 ships constituting the largest navy in the world in addition the plan s overall battle force is expected to grow to 460 ships by 2030 given its narrower scope of operations and geographic commitments than our navy the plan has enough ships to pose a serious challenge to the u s navy this reality becomes particularly stark when one considers the likely areas of aggression lie close to the chinese mainland home to the largest missile force in the world china is rapidly developing new capabilities in october 2021 the chinese tested a hypersonic vehicle that partially circumnavigated the globe they are building next generation strategic missile submarines fifth generation fighter aircraft and by 2023 china expects to launch its third aircraft carrier as china ascends the don must remain ready to respond to threats from russia north korea and iran as well as non state actors such as those in the middle east africa and south and central asia the russian federation continues to modernize its forces and is pushing the technological envelope with its development of hypersonic missiles tactical nuclear weapons and modern submarines recent events in eastern europe highlight russia s willingness to leverage its military to achieve its

territorial claims and challenge to freedom of navigation in the south china sea the prc uses every advantage in a coercive extractive and dangerously irresponsible manner beijing uses economic leverage like predatory lending to force governments from asia to africa to south america to cede critical infrastructure and natural resources it uses diplomatic leverage to exact political retribution against other countries and to expand its sphere of influence it leverages technology to steal personal information and intellectual property and subvert the free flow of communication around the world and finally it uses military leverage to threaten its neighbors challenge established norms and attempt to control international waters as its own the prc threatens u s interests undermines alliances and partnerships and degrades the free and open international order introduction 2022 1 12 fy 2023 department of the navy budget figure 1 2 operational context the spectrum of potential conflict the u s must prepare for is wide potential adversaries can attack in multiple domains and geographic locations the u s and its allies currently defend against offensive cyber operations on multiple fronts to include regular operations from both china and russia even small scale actors have potential to threaten the u s with asymetric attacks the don must have the capability to defend the country and our allies in multiple domains to include the sea air and the cyber realm it must be able to do this in cooperation with sister services and allies and it must be able to succeed in multiple domains simultaneously since the time of the barbary pirates our navy and marine corps team has protected the seaways that are the lifeblood of u s global economic activity the vast majority of the world s manufactured goods are transported by ocean freight a substantial amount of the world s internet traffic traverse seafloor communication lines and a large amount of natural resources reside in ocean environments with so much depending on safe access to the world s oceans priority must be given to the sea going military services china in particular has chosen to enhance its ability to project military power into the maritime domain from more aggressive overflight of taiwan airspace to the militarization of reefs and islands in the south china sea china grows

unafraid of the scrutiny navy and marine corps leaders use the lessons learned from the audit as a means of improving our warfighting capability and readiness and demonstrating excellence as an example the marine corps will be undergoing a one time two year audit cycle for fy 2022 through fy 2023 the two year audit cycle will give auditors sufficient time to complete necessary year end

these actions in addition to business process improvements will require an investment in resources to complete them this investment will yield dividends ultimately resulting in a favorable opinion on
